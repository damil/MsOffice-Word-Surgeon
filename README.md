# MsOffice-Word-Surgeon

Tamper wit the guts of Microsoft docx documents, with regexes

This module supports a few operations for modifying or extracting text
from Microsoft Word documents in '.docx' format -- therefore the name
'surgeon'. Since a surgeon does not give life, there is no support for
creating fresh documents; if you have such needs, use one of the other
packages listed in the L<SEE ALSO> section. To my knowledge, this is the
only solution (even in other languages) for applying regular expressions
to the contents of Word documents.
